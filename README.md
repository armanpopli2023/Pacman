# Pacman
C++ basic Pacman game
By Arman Popli and Haozhe Dong

In Comp_Sci 211 with Jesse Tov, students were asked to develop a final game project with a partner. My partner Haozhe and I chose to develop a version of pacman utilizing C++ structures we learned about throughout the course including Professor Tov's game engine. 

Here is a brief description of the project: the controller.cxx class controls all of the sprites on the board; the model.cxx class creates a visual representation (the game board); the view.cxx class creates all of the sprites and makes sure they stay on the board.
